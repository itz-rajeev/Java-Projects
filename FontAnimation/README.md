The FontAnimation application presents the concepts of Graphics and multi-threading in
java. The application creates an applet which draws a text and keeps on increasing its font size to
a defined maximum limit and then reduces the font size back to the original size. The process is
dynamic and continuous. The user is provided options to change the text and text color. Events
and listeners have also been used in the application.
